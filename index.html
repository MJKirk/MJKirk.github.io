<p>
I am currently a postdoc at La Sapienza in Rome, as well as an associate member of the INFN Roma1 group.
Previously, I studied for my undergraduate degree at King's College, Cambridge, before completing my PhD at the <a href="https://www.ippp.dur.ac.uk/">IPPP</a>, Durham University with my supervisor <a href="https://www.ippp.dur.ac.uk/profile/lenz">Alex Lenz</a>.
</p>

<h4>Publications</h4>
<p>
A list of my publications can be found in the INSPIRE database <a href="https://inspirehep.net/search?ln=en&p=exactauthor:M.Kirk.2">here</a>.
You can also check my <a href="https://inspirehep.net/authors/1452491">INSPIRE profile</a> or my <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0845-7227">ORCID profile</a>.

<h4>Research Area</h4>
<p>Flavour Physics &ndash; <i>B</i> meson mixing, heavy meson lifetimes, BSM. </p>

<h4>Research Interests</h4>
<p>
I am interested in investigating anomalies in the flavour sector, and how they might be connected to new physics. I am also interested in improving the precision of the theory predictions in flavour physics, in order to better distinguish between the Standard Model and New Physics.
Some of my current projects include looking at naturalness of new physics models for flavour anomalies, and working to improve less well known theory parameters for B<sub>s</sub> mixing, while I have previously worked on the overlap of dark matter models and flavour and model independent BSM effects in quark flavour physics.

<h4>Other activites</h4>
<ul>
<li>I was the theory convener for the "Mixing and CP violation in Beauty and Charm" stream at the <a href="https://indico.cern.ch/e/Implications2019/">LHCb Implications 2019 workshop</a>.
</ul>

<h4>Outreach</h4>
<p>
I was heavily involved in outreach during my time at the IPPP, including taking part in the <a href="https://royalsociety.org/science-events-and-lectures/2017/summer-science-exhibition/exhibits/modelling-the-invisible/">Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition</a> as part of the <a href="https://www.modellinginvisible.org/">Modelling the Invisible</a> exhibit as well various more local outreach events at Durham University for local schools.
</p>
<p>As part of my commitment to outreach, I gave several talks to the wider postgraduate community in Durham:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="outreach/talks/mcr_research_seminar_2018-07-31.pdf">Chi ha ordinato quel?</a> - Talk for postgrads at Grey College MCR</li>
